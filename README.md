# Introduction

This is a simple project to demonstrate the use of the Go programming language.

The project is structured according to the Go project layout guidelines [1].
For the REST API, the guidelines from [2] are used.

Struct validation is done using the `github.com/go-playground/validator/v10` package. [3][4]

The LeapYear unit test example belongs to Structure and Interpretation of Test Cases • Kevlin Henney • GOTO 2022 [5]
